# DO_dataset_US_CE
#### Supporting data for the riverine deoxygenation study in the United States (US) and Central Europe (CE).

The supporting data here include a site list of 580 US rivers and 216 CE rivers, and the temporal data of dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature (WT), and discharge (Q) in the US, and 66 basin attributes across the categories of climate, hydrology, topography, land use, and soils.

Due to limits in data sharing from CE data providers, raw water quality data (DO & WT) can be accessed from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) & Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) at https://doi.org/10.25678/0004AV, German data from the State Agency for the Environment Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg at https://udo.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/public/pages/home/welcome.xhtml, the Bavarian State Office for the Environment at https://www.gkd.bayern.de/en/rivers/chemistry , and Austrian data from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Regions and Tourism at https://wasser.umweltbundesamt.at/h2odb/fivestep/abfrageQdPublic.xhtml. 

Prepared discharge data for CE (Q) can be obtained from the LamaH-CE dataset. Attributes in the US and CE are compiled from the database of Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow dataset Version II (GAGES-II) and LamaH-CE, respectively. Please cite the primary sources, if you use any of this data.

Model data include daily DO and WT in the US and CE.
