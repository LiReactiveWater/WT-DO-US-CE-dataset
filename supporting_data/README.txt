The supporting data here include a site list of 580 US rivers and 216 CE rivers, and temporal data of dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature (WT), and discharge (Q) in the US, and basin attributes across 5 categories of climate, hydrology, topography, land use, and soils in the US and CE.

Model data include daily DO and WT in the US and CE.

Attributes in the US and CE are compiled from the database of Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow dataset Version II (GAGES-II) and LamaH-CE, respectively.
